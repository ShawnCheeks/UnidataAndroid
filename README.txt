NOTES ON SETTING UP ANDROID ENVIRONMENT

First off, you will need the Android SDK found here: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
I used Android Version 4.2.2 and the Eclipse version that came with it.

Other libraries (libs) used were: 

android-support-v4.jar (available as a download from within the SDK)
achartengine-1.1.0.jar (available for download at http://achartengine.org/)
commons-io-2.4.jar (available for download at http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/)

with google-play-services_lib.jar as a dependency (https://developers.google.com/)

They should already be saved in the app, but if for some reason it's not connecting, you can find more here.

Also, you can contact me at cheeks5@marshall.edu if I left out something.
